# Preface {-}

**This is the course material for learning the essentials of R and RStudio and using them for data wrangling and visualisation.**

The course is broken into **three parts**. The first part introduces some R essentials prior to getting stuck into the data:

* Using RStudio and RStudio projects

* Starting to script

* Using libraries

* Vectors and why they're boring-but-important

* Using dataframes and loading simple data

* How to download and use the course material, either on your own machine using RStudio, or using RStudio in the cloud.


**Part two** (starting with 'The first principle of data visualisation') looks at data wrangling and visualisation using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) and [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org). We'll work through a typical example from first principles, using English house price data (with some additional data we'll link).

**Part three** will be more freeform. There's the option of working through some further examples included in this course (from 'six and a bit options' below) and/or we can work out other data viz ideas to pursue and work together to achieve them.

You can use the navigation bar on the left to explore the material, or look at ['getting the course project folder and data'][Getting the course project folder and data] to download the course - this includes a PDF of the course.
